                <p>
                    Ah yes, the familiar cycle: You sit down to write a cover letter, open a blank document, check your
                    email, browse cover letter examples, do some chores, watch that cursor blink a few more times, and
                    finally Google something like “how to write a cover letter”—which hopefully brought you here. But
                    you
                    still might be thinking something to the effect of: Does anyone really read cover letters? Why do
                    they
                    even exist?
                    <br><br>
                    First off: Yes, we can assure you that cover letters do, in fact, get read. To some hiring managers,
                    they're the most important part of your job application. And regardless, you don't want to miss the
                    opportunity to tell prospective employers who you are, showcase why they should hire you, and stand
                    out
                    above all the other candidates.
                    <br><br>
                    To ensure your letter is in amazing shape (and crafting it is as painless as possible), we've got
                    easy-to-follow steps plus examples, a few bonus tips, and answers to frequently asked questions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>What is a cover letter and why is it important?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A cover letter is a brief (one page or less) note that you write to a hiring manager or recruiter to go
                    along with your resume and other application materials. Done well, a cover letter gives you the chance
                    to speak directly to how your skills and experience line up with the specific job you're pursuing. It
                    also affords you an opportunity to hint to the reviewer that you're likable, original, and likely to be
                    a great addition to the team.
                    <br><br>
                    Instead of using cover letters to their strategic advantage, most job applicants blabber on and on about
                    what they want, toss out bland, cliché-filled paragraphs that essentially just regurgitate their resume,
                    or go off on some strange tangent in an effort to be unique.
                    <br><br>
                    Given this reality, imagine the leg up you'll have if you learn how to do cover letters right.

                <h2>Bonus cover letter tips to give you an edge over the competition</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As you write your cover letter, here are a few more tips to consider to help you stand out from the
                    stack of applicants:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep it short and sweet: There are always exceptions to the rule, but in general, for resumes
                        and cover letters alike, don't go over a page. Need help? Check out these tips for cutting down
                        your cover letter.</li>
                    <li>Never apologize for your missing experience: When you don't meet all of the job requirements,
                        it's tempting to use lines like, “Despite my limited experience as a manager…” or “While I may
                        not have direct experience in marketing…” But why apologize? Instead of drawing attention to
                        your weaknesses, emphasize the strengths and transferable skills you do have.</li>
                    <li>Strike the right tone: You want to find a balance between being excessively formal in your
                        writing—which can make you come off as stiff or insincere—and being too conversational. Let your
                        personality shine through, for sure, but also keep in mind that a cover letter shouldn't sound
                        like a text to an old friend.</li>
                    <li>Consider writing in the company's “voice”: Cover letters are a great way to show that you
                        understand the environment and culture of the company and industry. Spending some time reading
                        over the company website or stalking their social media before you get started can be a great
                        way to get in the right mindset—you'll get a sense for the company's tone, language, and
                        culture, which are all things you'll want to mirror—especially if writing skills are a core part
                        of the job.</li>
                    <li>Go easy on the enthusiasm: We can't tell you how many cover letters we've seen from people who
                        are “absolutely thrilled for the opportunity” or “very excitedly applying!” Yes, you want to
                        show personality, creativity, and excitement. But downplay the adverbs a bit, and keep the level
                        of enthusiasm for the opportunity genuine and believable.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>The bottom line with cover letters is this: They matter, much more than the naysayers will have you
                    believe. If you nail yours, you could easily go from the “maybe” pile straight to “Oh, hell yes.”
