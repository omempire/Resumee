                    Resumes are like fingerprints because no two are alike. This makes sense when you consider the
                    number of variables when creating a resume.
                    <br><br>
                    Not only does a resume reflect a person's unique set of skills and experience, it SHOULD also be
                    customized to the job or industry being pursued. Think about it: why would, say, a junior accountant
                    and a senior architect want similar looking resumes?
                    <br><br>
                    Adding to this complexity, there are all kinds of mixed signals and advice from different people
                    about resumes. How long they should be, what sections to include/exclude, whether you should include
                    a photo…and so on, and so on.
                    <br><br>
                    Wouldn't it be great if there was some way to cut through this chaos? To know exactly what the
                    current standards are for resume writing. It would be even better if there were examples of what
                    recruiters in specific industries want to see from job applicants. That would make creating a
                    professional resume a whole lot easier.
                    <br><br>
                    Well, you're in luck. Our team joined forces with recruiters and employers to create resume examples
                    for various industries and positions. According to this network of recruitment experts and human
                    resource professionals, it is really helpful to check professional resume examples before starting
                    to write your own.
                    <br><br>
                    Following resume examples can give you inspiration when you feel tired of your existing resume, or
                    if you feel stuck on what a new resume should look like.

                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    More importantly, up-to-date resume samples capture present-day best practices for resume writing.
                    In other words, years of research and expertise are built-in for you to follow and apply to your own
                    resume.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the most important considerations for a resume is the overall resume format. There are three
                    types of resumes formats: reverse chronological, functional and combined. The format you choose will
                    depend on both where you are at in your career and the industry you work in.
                    <br><br>
                    In a functional format, there is greater emphasis on skills than with the reverse chronological
                    format, which emphasizes experience. The combined format gives equal weighting to both these
                    sections, with some flexibility.
                    <br><br>
                    The examples provided below all use the combined format, even for jobs that are very
                    “skills-oriented” or technical. If you're an architect, a data analyst or computer scientist, it's
                    important you find a way to showcase your work history alongside your vast skillset.
                    <br><br>
                    We encourage you to explore the following resume examples developed using our resume builder. We've
                    developed them for dozens of professions in all kinds of industries: from customer service to
