                <p>
                    A new year always brings with it new changes and the hiring market is no exception. Writing a resume
                    in 2022 requires a different approach to previous years for a number of reasons.
                    <br><br>
                    If you are looking for a new job this year, a refreshed resume is a must. This is true no matter
                    when and why you're re-entering the job market. However, if a long period of time has passed since
                    your last application, it's a good idea to get up-to-date with the latest trends.
                    <br><br>
                    This article explains what your resume should include in 2022. It looks in detail at all tips and
                    tricks you'll need to keep your profile relevant and to navigate some of the new quirks of the
                    hiring process in this new decade.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Use a Resume Statement Instead of An Objective</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Resume Objectives were once the mainstay of successful resumes. However, times change and fashions
                    wane. An objective simply doesn't pack the same punch that it used to in the past.
                    <br><br>
                    Indeed, it's out with objectives and instead in with Resume Statements.
                    <br><br>
                    A resume statement differs from an objective as it focuses more on where you've been rather than
                    where you're going. It provides a quick summary of the candidate and allows you to signpost some of
                    your most impressive features front and center.
                    <br><br>
                    Objectives differ slightly from this as they examine your goals and explain why you're eager to get
                    the job. This can have some value, especially if you're a more inexperienced candidate. However, it
                    focuses too much on what you want rather than the needs of the company.
                    <br><br>
                    A summary statement, on the other hand, gives the recruiter the information they want and need
                    upfront. It details the most important work you've done, your background and one or two noteworthy
                    skills that you have.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Optimize Your Document for Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence's role in the hiring process is very much a fact of life in today's world.
                    According to Forbes, around 98% of Fortune 500 companies and 75% of employers self-report using
                    Applicant Tracking Software (ATS).
                    <br><br>
                    When you write your resume, you must prepare for the fact that it will be assessed by an algorithm
                    before it even reaches a human hiring manager. If you fail to optimize properly you will get cut
                    from the process immediately.
                    <br><br>
                    There are only a few important tricks to beating ATS, these include:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using a good number (but not too many) keywords on the page</li>
                    <li>Avoiding spelling and grammar mistakes</li>
                    <li>Not cluttering the template with custom graphics and fonts</li>
                    <li>Submitting your document in the right file format</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It's because of this many of our templates are designed the way they are. They have been created to
                    get around these filters and to be easily machine-readable. They also can be downloaded in optimized
                    PDF and .TXT formats to give you the best chance of getting to the interview stage.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Keep The Template Design Clean and Simple</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As we've just seen, keeping things simpler is important. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't
                    add a little touch of flair to the design.
                    <br><br>
                    The critical thing to remember is that less is more. You shouldn't overdesign the document as this
                    will make it harder to read and could also make it harder for machines to process.
                    <br><br>
                    Some of the best tips to follow include:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using neutral colors</li>
                    <li>Writing in size 12 text</li>
                    <li>Choosing an easy-to-read font like Times New Roman or Arial</li>
                    <li>Balancing the text-to-white-space ratio</li>
                    <li>Sticking to 1-2 pages in length</li>
                    <li>Replacing long paragraphs with bullet-point lists</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>Show off Your Most Up-To-Date Certifications</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If 2022 is the year that you finally go for your ideal job, adding some of your new and improved
                    skills will be essential. As workers, we're always developing and in some industries not having the
                    right and most recent certifications can be a real set-back.
                    <br><br>
                    This will be especially important if you work in a technology-driven industry like IT, Web
                    Development or if you have a career in public health or pharmaceuticals. These sectors need
                    candidates to show that they've been keeping up with development trends and new discoveries.
                    <br><br>
                    Make sure examples of these appear in the resume's education section. If possible ensure to show
                    that they are in date and fully cover the necessities of the job at the present time. You may need
                    to provide evidence of these certifications later.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>Quantify Everything</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    KPIs are the not-so-hidden gems of an effective resume. When you're applying for a new job remember
                    to back all your work experience and skills up with evidence.
                    <br><br>
                    Writing KPIs on your resume is a particularly important step to quantifying your performance over
                    the years. These will show the employer reading your document how your abilities turned into
                    measurable results.
                    <br><br>
                    This can be either as percentages, revenue numbers or simply numbers of units made or sold. However,
                    they need to be on the page if you want to see results from your document.
                    <br><br>
                    As you can see, building a resume for the 2022 job market is about smaller optimizations rather than
                    a grand overhaul. However, putting time, as well as care and attention to your document is
                    worthwhile in the long run.
                    <br><br>
